# Status

Originally made in August/September 2021, this web app is a basic status page. It fetches data from UptimeRobot and displays on a simple, minimalistic site.

Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [UptimeRobot API](https://uptimerobot.com/api/) and [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) (prior to the release it was using [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)).
